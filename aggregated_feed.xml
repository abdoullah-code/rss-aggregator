      <description>Fujifilm&#8217;s unusual X Half elicited a lot of feelings from photographers when it came out earlier this year &#8212; from &#8220;That looks like so much fun,&#8221; to &#8220;Wait, it costs how much?&#8220; Its $849.95 list price felt way too high for what is, by all accounts, a fun, unserious little point-and-shoot.
