      <description>Google could owe you some money, now that it's moving to settle a class-action lawsuit over how it handled recordings captured when its devices were activated by something other than Google Assistant's actual trigger word, "Ok Google." German outlet VRT NWS's 2019 report exposed the issue, and court filings from last Friday say the proposed [&#8230;]</description>

      <description>One of the biggest constraints currently facing AI builders who want to deploy agents in service of their individual or enterprise goals is the "working memory" required to manage complex, multi-stage engineering projects.Typically, when a AI agent operates purely on a stream of text or voice-based conversation, it lacks the structural permanence to handle dependencies. It knows what to do, but it often forgets why it is doing it, or in what order.With the release of Tasks for Claude Code (introduced in v2.1.16) last week, Anthropic has introduced a solution that is less about "AI magic" and m...</description>

      <description>It looks like Ubisoft is planning even more layoffs to accompany last week's studio closures and game cancellations, according to reporting by IGN. The company is planning a massive reduction of the workforce in its Paris headquarters. It has proposed the loss of up to 200 jobs, which is nearly 20 percent of the current staff.
This will be organized under France's Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, in which staff can agree to form a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement. It's not a done deal just yet, with a company spokesperson saying "at this stage, this remains a...</description>

      <description>Because technology is apparently obligated to continue to march on, Google says that the oldest Nest Thermostats are basically obsolete. 
Back in October,&#160;Google&#160;ended software support&#160;for the&#160;original and second-generation Nest Learning Thermostats. On the surface, that doesn&#8217;t seem totally unreasonable, considering those original devices are roughly 14 years old at this point. If you have one, you can still use it as a thermostat, but it will no longer connect to the internet. As a result, you can&#8217;t connect to it using the Nest or Google Home apps....</description>
