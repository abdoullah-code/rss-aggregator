      <description>Riot Games has confirmed that it&#8217;s working on a massive update for League of Legends after Bloomberg published a report saying that the company has plans to remake the game.

In a video announcement discussing Riot&#8217;s plans for League after 2026, executive producer Paul Belleza denied that the developer is working on League 2 like rumors have been suggesting, but he admitted that  it is working on a big update that will arrive in 2027.

That means your new Nintendo Switch 2 gets a lot more memory with transfer speeds reaching 800MB/s. The specs are on par with ...</description>

We have compiled all the best gear with our highest review scores in each category, after thousands of hours of testing. We&#8217;ve got the Switch 2, AirPods Pro 3 and DJI&#8217;s top drone for most of you. Anecdotally, Anker&#8217;s Laptop Power Bank, with two built-in charging cables, has been the sleeper hit of the Engadget team, with four editors making it their power bank of choice. I think it&#8217;s the retractable cable.

      <description>SpaceX said it experienced an anomaly with one if its Starlink satellites that was likely caused by a small explosion. "The anomaly led to venting of the propulsion tank, a rapid decay in semi-major axis by about 4 km [2.5 miles] and the release of a small number of trackable low relatively velocity objects," Starlink wrote in a post on X. Orbital tracking company LeoLabs assessed that the issue was caused by an "internal energetic source rather than a collision with space debris or another object."&#160;
SpaceX said it's working with NASA and the US Space Force to track the remains of the object. ...</description>
