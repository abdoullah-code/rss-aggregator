      <description>A collective of Colorado lawmakers wants to put an end to "ghost guns" and their rising popularity. Earlier this week, the state's House Judiciary Committee voted in a 7-4 majority to pass the bill, HB26-1144, along for a decision with the full House of Representatives. The proposed law would "prohibit the use of a three-dimensional printer, or similar technology, to make a firearm or a firearm component."

      <description>Samsung's next flagship devices will offer Perplexity as part of an expansion to support multiple AI agents in Galaxy AI.

Pour surveiller de larges zones, il n&#8217;est pas rare de devoir s&#8217;&#233;quiper de plusieurs cam&#233;ras. Avec son Argus 4 Pro, Reolink vous propose plut&#244;t de miser sur une cam&#233;ra avec un champ de vision de 180&#176; en 8 Mpx. Cela suffit-il pour en faire un cerb&#232;re de qualit&#233; ?
