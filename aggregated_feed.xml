      <description>Mullvad, a virtual private network (VPN) named after the Swedish word for "mole," is often recognized as one of the best VPNs for privacy. I put it on my best VPN list for exactly that reason. I've got huge respect for the extra lengths Mullvad goes to in order to ensure its user's privacy.
To give you a preview, Mullvad is one of the few VPNs &#8212; other than my normal privacy recommendation, Proton VPN &#8212; that lets users pay entirely in cash. But even Proton VPN asks for an email address to make an account and uses a few marketing cookies on its own website. Mullvad represents every account as a ...</description>

Last week, a new piece of public art appeared outside of the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) headquarters, located in Rome&#8217;s Piazza Lauro de Bosis. The graffiti centers an image of an Olympic ski jumper sailing through the air, while, from below, an ICE agent in a tactical vest points a gun directly at the jumper&#8217;s heart. Above the scene, the Olympic Rings are featured, with a twist: the red ring has been reimagined as the bleeding crosshairs of a deadly weapon....</description>

The budgets are too big. It doesn&#8217;t really make sense. It will never look real.&#8221;...</description>

In addition, it features flush door handles similar to Tesla&#8217;s, which were designed for aerodynamics but which China recently banned out of safety concerns. The ...</description>
