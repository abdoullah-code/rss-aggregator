      <description>AI is reshaping behavioral health by supporting clinicians and strengthening patient relationships.
While headlines about AI replacing workers dominated 2025, behavioral health is charting a different path. The industry thrives on human connection, measuring success in trust, healing, and human relationships, not throughput. That&#8217;s not to say AI isn&#8217;t rapidly reshaping the industry&#8212;it is. Its role here fundamentally differs because it supports clinicians rather than sidelines them....</description>

      <description>When Meta first announced its display-enabled smart glasses last year, it teased a handwriting feature that allows users to send messages by tracing letters with their hands. Now, the company is starting to roll it out, with people enrolled in its early access program getting it first,I got a chance to try the feature at CES and it made me want to start wearing my Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses more often. When I reviewed the glasses last year, I wrote about how one of&#160; my favorite tings about the neural band is that it reduced my reliance on voice commands. I've always felt a bit self conscious...</description>

      <description>While wave upon wave of smartglasses and face-based wearables crash on the shores of CES, traditional glasses really haven&#8217;t changed much over the hundreds of years we&#8217;ve been using them. The last innovation, arguably, was progressive multifocals that blended near and farsighted lenses &#8212; and that was back in the 1950s. It makes sense that autofocusing glasses maker IXI thinks it&#8217;s time to modernize glasses.
After recently announcing a 22-gram (0.7-ounce) prototype frame, the startup is here in Las Vegas to show off working prototypes of its lenses, a key component of its autofocus glasses, whi...</description>
