      <description>Home appliance company Cosori has released a stainless steel air fryer because why not. The Iconic Air Fryer debuted in all its shiny glory at Pepcom this week, a media showcase event ahead of CES.
Cosori says the air fryer is meant to address a pain point in the market regarding consumer concern over heating food in plastic air fryers. The company's answer to this is a 6.5-quart stainless steel fryer with a ceramic, nonstick coating on all surfaces that come in contact with food. Iconic has a brushed metal finish that Cosori says is corrosion resistant.
The controls and display for the fryer ...</description>

      <description>Riot Games has a pretty long legacy as a PC gaming studio, but the company is spreading out into consoles with its newest title. 2XKO will land on consoles on January 20, to coincide with the start of its first season. The game will be available globally for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S with cross-play support, allowing current players to access their existing progress on a PC account.&#160;&#160;The formula for most recent Riot projects (with the notable exception of Valorant), has been to take the extensive character roster from its long-standing League of Legends MOBA and place them into oth...</description>

      <description>IO Interactive just revealed minimum and recommended specs for the PC build of 007 First Light. The company recommends 32GB of RAM and 12GB of VRAM. In a normal world, this wouldn't be news, as modern NVIDIA GPUs certainly have more than enough VRAM. However, we live in a world where AI companies gobble up lots of memory.
This has caused newer cards to tick up in price, with more hikes to come. Older cards like the RTX 3070 just won't cut it, as that one ships with 8GB of VRAM. Standard RAM is also getting much more expensive, putting that 32GB out of reach for many gamers. In other words, pla...</description>

      <description>If I were building a new PC today, I'd go for a small form factor mATX or ITX build. With companies like Fractal Design and Lian Li making cases that can fit modern GPUs without sacrificing on thermals, you don't need to settle for the old mid-tower monstrosities of yesteryear. And that's why PNY's new "Slim&#8221; model RTX 50-series designs caught my eye. All three variants, covering the 5070, 5070 Ti and 5080, are two slot cards with just a pair of 120mm fans for cooling. As a result, even the largest of the three new models, the 5080, is relatively svelte, coming in at 11.8-inches or 300mm long....</description>

Star Wars Outlaws and Resident Evil Village headline the first wave of the January lineup.If you (perhaps wisely) held off on spending $70 on Ubisoft's first stab at a Star Wars game, here's your chance to try it for less. Star Wars Outlaws sets you loose in an open world as the young thief Kay Vess. The third-person action title includes melee, shooting and stealth. There&#8217;s even some speeder chases and space dogfights to scratch your (boilerplate) Star Wars itch. Does it do anything novel or innovative to j...</description>

      <description>On Monday, we went hands-on at CES with LG's new Sound Suite speakers featuring Dolby Atmos FlexConnect and now we have pricing for the entire lineup. The modular home audio system consists of four speakers that include a soundbar, surround speakers and a subwoofer.
The centerpiece of the group is the H7 soundbar, which will retail for $1,000. The soundbar uses FlexConnect to optimize sound based on the layout of a room and its location therein. This is intended to solve for when a speaker can't be perfectly placed to deliver optimal sound, especially spatial audio.
The H7 also has a feature L...</description>

Navee says it can reach a top speed of 43 mph and has a max range of 87 miles.

In moments of political chaos, deepfakes and AI-generated content can thrive. Case in point: the online reaction to the US government&#8217;s shocking operation in Venezuela over the weekend, which included multiple airstrikes and a clandestine mission that ended with the capture of the country&#8217;s president, Nicol&#225;s Maduro, and his wife. They were soon charged with narcoterrorism, along with other crimes, and they&#8217;re currently being held at a federal prison in New York.&#160;...</description>
