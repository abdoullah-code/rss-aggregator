The custom &#8220;vanbulance&#8221; serves a dual purpose: preventing on-set exhaust fumes (which could harm the cast and crew) and integrating a green storyline. &#8220;As an added benefit, the elimination of engine noise brought a welcome quiet while cameras were rolling,&#8221; Rivan wrote in a blog post.Among other modifications,...</description>
