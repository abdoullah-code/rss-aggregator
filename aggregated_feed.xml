Dell CEO Michael Dell and other investors have smaller stakes in the new company.&#160;The terms of the deal were first leaked last month, after TikTok CEO Shou Chew reportedl...</description>

      <description>Vimeo just got hit by a brutal round of layoffs, according to a report by Business Insider. Staffers are posting on various social media sites that the layoffs have impacted most of the company, including the entire video team. Vimeo is a video-hosting platform, so that sounds bad.
&#8220;Yesterday, following Vimeo&#8217;s recent acquisition by a private equity firm, I learned that I, along with a large portion of the company, was impacted by layoffs,&#8221; wrote the company&#8217;s former vice president of Global Brand &amp; Creative, Dave Brown.

      <description>Tesla just objectively decreased the value of the Model 3 and Model Y. On Thursday, the company said it&#8217;s paywalling its lane-centering feature, Autosteer, for new purchases of the two EVs in the US and Canada. This was previously a standard feature. Lane centering is now part of the Full Self-Driving Supervised (FSD) package, which costs $99 per month.Speculating on why Tesla would do this doesn't require much imagination. Remember the pay package Tesla shareholders approved for Musk in November? One of his requirements for receiving up to $1 trillion is reaching 10 million active FSD subscri...</description>
